# GDipSA ASP .NET Core Project
This is a shopping cart web application using .NET Core framework created by my team for NUS-ISS GDipSA course, named Software4You.

## Project Specifications / Requirements 
Users visiting the website to purchase software are assumed to have already registered with the system. The project thus covers the following basic functions: 
Login/Logout, View Product Listing, Search for Products, Add to Cart, View Cart, Price Computation, Management of Purchase History and Activation Codes for the Purchased Software.

Users can choose whether to login prior to adding products to cart. They will be directed to the login page upon checkout if they have yet to login, and their shopping cart will be preserved accordingly. 

## My contributions to the Project
My main contributions include: 
1. Management of Purchase History and Activation Codes (including design of data models, controller, HTML/CSS/JavaScript) 
2. JavaScript for search bar and login 
3. Enhancement to overall layout and appearance 
4. Overall integration, testing and debugging
